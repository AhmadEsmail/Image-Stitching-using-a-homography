There is a car, and it is equipped with two digital cameras. The cameras are synchronized in time. We have sample images for both cameras.  stitching the images of the two cameras by a homography where: 

 (i) Taking two images that were taken at the same time. The homography should be estimated only for one image pair. 

 (ii) Doing feature matching using ASIFT
