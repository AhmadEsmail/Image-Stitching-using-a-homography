# Image-Stitching-using-a-homography

There is a car, and it is equipped with two digital cameras. The cameras are synchronized in time. We have sample images for both cameras.  
The task is to stitch the images of the two cameras by a homography where: 

 (i) Taking two images that were taken at the same time. The homography should be estimated only for one image pair. 

 (ii) Doing feature matching using ASIFT
